\section*{Question 1}

A Business Process Oriented Organization \cite{kohlbacher} is based upon the work that suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the organization. IST is a public and educational institution that have the concern, as well as, main focus on forming Engineers and Researchers. However performance is a field of interest to improve, IST do not have the need of implementing a “process view” since the main focus is not to profit from their students.

\subsection*{The Answer}

Because of that my answer is NO, IST is NOT a Business Process oriented organization, since it brings zero improvement on an educational public institution.
